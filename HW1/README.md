Design and implemented a C language program based on the following specifications:
1. The user interface will prompt for ten unique character strings to be entered from the keyboard. Each character string must have a strlen() value between 1 and 25 inclusive, otherwise an error message is displayed and the user is re-prompted. The program sorts this series of ten character strings (based on strcmp()), and reprints all ten strings in ascending OR descending order based on user specification. The program then prints and labels the character string with the lowest ascii value and that with the highest ascii value
as determined by strcmp(). Character strings may NOT include the following characters: ’!’, ’@’, ’#’, ’$’, ‘%’, ‘^’, ’(’, or ’)’.
2. Include additional error checking for: Empty string, Duplicate string, Character other than ‘A’ or ‘D’ for sort specification.
